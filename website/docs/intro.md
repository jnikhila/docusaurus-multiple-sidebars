# Multiple Sidebar using Docusaurus

Welcome to our **Docusaurus** project that demonstrates how to set up **multiple sidebars** in a documentation website. This project is tailored to provide flexibility for navigating through different sections of the documentation with ease.

## Multiple Sidebar Navigation

This project showcases multiple sidebars, allowing you to split your documentation into logical groups. Each section gets its own dedicated sidebar to provide better navigation and user experience.
