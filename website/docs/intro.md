# Multiple Sidebar using Docusaurus

Welcome to our **Docusaurus** project that demonstrates how to set up **multiple sidebars** in a documentation website. This project is tailored to provide flexibility for navigating through different sections of the documentation with ease.

## Multiple Sidebar Navigation

This project showcases multiple sidebars, allowing you to split your documentation into logical groups. Each section gets its own dedicated sidebar to provide better navigation and user experience.

We’ve split the documentation into the following sections:

- **Getting Started**: Learn how to get up and running with this project and understand the basic setup.
- **Deployment**: Step-by-step guides to help you deploy your application in various environments.
- **Code Best Practices**: Find guidelines and tips for writing quality code and contributing to the project.

Check out the documentation links below to explore these sections in detail!

## Why Use Multiple Sidebars?

Multiple sidebars allow you to create well-organized, scalable documentation, especially for projects with various distinct areas. For example:
- You can group "Getting Started" topics in one sidebar.
- Group advanced topics like "Deployment" in another.
- Provide in-depth guides and best practices under a different sidebar.

### How to Configure Multiple Sidebars
